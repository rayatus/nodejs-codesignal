# nodejs_codesignal
[CodeSignal's](https://codesignal.com/) own solutions writen in NodeJS just for *learning purposes*.

There's a folder for every exercise where the *solution.js* is the one that contains the requiered code for CodeSignal, also it may contain other files as:
* *runner.js* which is the one that launches the tests where I've been having some problems.
* *test_XX.js* represents every test file where just evaluating if the test execution has been passed or not.
